# project-1-enhancing-my-memory

Purpose: I am in the process of becoming better developer, computer scientist, and data scientist. I am using this project to my ability to organize my thoughts and ideas. I am also using this project to practice my skills in writing and presenting my ideas to ChatGPT and other things.


## Future Design & Functionality Ideas:
 

### My Ideas based on what I want to enhance:

#### Current Version:

* [ ] Prevent auto refresh
* [ ] Display time and date
* [ ] Display original text and entered text
* [ ] Include asynchronusfunctionality JavaScript
* [ ] Use this for music chords and e numbers
* [ ] Save scores in local storage
* [ ] Create a score board


 #### In a future version:

* [ ] Save scores in a database
* [ ] Create a visualization of past scores

 ### ChatGPT's Questions:

- Do you have any specific requirements for the database that stores the memorized content?
- Will users need to create an account or log in to use the website?
- How will you ensure the security of user data and prevent unauthorized access to it?
- Do you have any additional features or functionality that you would like to include in the project?
- What is the target audience for this website?
- Do you have any design or branding guidelines that I should be aware of?
- What is the timeline for this project? Do you have any specific deadlines?
- Are there any other details that you would like to share about the project?

## Name of the project: Memorize

**Description of the project:** Memorize is a website that allows you to memorize anything you want. 
0) A title name: Testing Eman's memory, a textbox, and save button are the only things on the screen
1) The *User* **enters** the string that needs to be memorized in textbox

    - The textbox and save button disappear, entered text is stored in local storage

3) Once the *User* **clicks** the "start" button:
    - The user enters the what they remember in textbox
    - The timer begins
    - The website is calculating the % correct as the *User* is typing
4) The *User* **clicks** the "stop" button when the *User* is complete then a stats bar shows up that displays:
    - % correct
    - Time to complete
Design 
    - The style is dark futuristic
