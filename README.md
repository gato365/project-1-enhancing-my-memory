# project-1-enhancing-my-memory

Purpose: I am in the process of becoming better developer, computer scientist, and data scientist. I am using this project to my ability to organize my thoughts and ideas. I am also using this project to practice my skills in writing and presenting my ideas to ChatGPT and other things.


## Future Design & Functionality Ideas:
