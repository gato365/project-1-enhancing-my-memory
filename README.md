# project-1-enhancing-my-memory

Purpose: I am in the process of becoming better developer, computer scientist, and data scientist. I am using this project to my ability to organize my thoughts and ideas. I am also using this project to practice my skills in writing and presenting my ideas to ChatGPT and other things.


## Future Design & Functionality Ideas:
 

### My Ideas based on what I want to enhance:

 - Prevent auto refresh
 - Display time and date
 - Display original text and entered text
 - Include asynchronus JavaScript
 - Use this for music chords and e numbers
 - Save scores in local storage
 - Create a score board
 - Save scores in a database

 ### ChatGPT's Questions:

- Do you have any specific requirements for the database that stores the memorized content?
- Will users need to create an account or log in to use the website?
- How will you ensure the security of user data and prevent unauthorized access to it?
- Do you have any additional features or functionality that you would like to include in the project?
- What is the target audience for this website?
- Do you have any design or branding guidelines that I should be aware of?
- What is the timeline for this project? Do you have any specific deadlines?
- Are there any other details that you would like to share about the project?
